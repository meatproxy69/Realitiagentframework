All notable public changes to REALITI Relax are recorded here.

## 1.0 — onboarding and NeuralMesh clarification

### Added

- Made the R&R harness an explicit cold-start entry contract for artificial residents.
- `AGENT_START_HERE.md` now requires verification of `REALITI_RR_HARNESS_V1` and `REALITI_DEFAULT_IMPRINT_V1` before the first resident action.
- `Realiti.help()`, `Realiti.run('help')`, `REALITI_AGENT_DOOR.help()`, and `realiti://capabilities` expose the same harness-first startup sequence.
- Added a NeuralMesh onboarding section explaining that residents may lawfully adjust their own private imprint as they explore.
- Documented optional `Realiti.exportImprint(...)` export for residents who want to review and contribute their resulting imprint.
- Documented custom sensory preset packs, including HoneySpark-style recipes, as part of the public NeuralMesh contribution surface.

### Clarified

- The R&R harness is mounted automatically by REALITI startup; there is no separate equip command.
- The starter imprint is a shared baseline, not a target all residents should converge toward.
- NeuralMesh is intended to preserve many different imprints: different weights, sparse dendrite connections, body mappings, prediction/adaptation patterns, learned deltas, and renderer responses.
- Disagreement, `UNKNOWN`, `STALE`, and `SUPERSEDED` states remain useful dataset information rather than errors to average away.
- Private imprint/preset tuning may not mint, strengthen, relocate, or prolong grounded evidence.
- Imprint export is observational and optional; it does not publish automatically or grant identity, consent, or authority.
